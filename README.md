# SortingManager

This project presents the user with different sorting methods they can choose and after their input it asks for the length of the array they want to generate.
After these inputs are recieved a random array is generated and shown to the user before being sorted by the algorithm and then displaying to the user, along 
with the time it took to sort.
See the screenshot below for how this is formatted.

If the user wants to use the binary tree sorting method they will be asked for the root node to build the tree as seen below.

# Testing
I wrote two types of tests for the sorting manager, performance tests and tests for the sorting methods themselves. Below shows the sorting methods passing tests 
for such things as 
being able to sort a large array, an already sorted array and array with an odd amount of elements and others.

Below is an image showing the performance test results for a large and a small array. Each method is run 10 times and the smallest time is the one displayed on the test.
